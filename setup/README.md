## Workshop Setup

###  Google Cloud Console Setup

1 - The instructor will provide you with a temporary username / password to sign in to the Google Cloud Platform Console.

**Important:** To avoid conflicts with your personal account, please open a new incognito window for the rest of this lab.

Sign in to the Google Cloud Platform Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/home](https://console.cloud.google.com/home) with the provided credentials. In Welcome to your new account dialog, click Accept.

2 - Check I agree and click Agree and Continue

2 - If you see a top bar with Sign Up for Free Trial - DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE FREE TRIAL. Click Dismiss since you'll be using a pre-provisioned lab account. If you are doing this on your own account, then you may want the free trial.

3 - Select the only Google Cloud Platform project in the project list. If you don't see a project, let the instructor know!

##  Google Cloud Shell

You will do most of the work from the [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/developer-shell/#how_do_i_get_started), a command line environment running in the Cloud. This Debian-based virtual machine is loaded with all the development tools youâ€™ll need (docker, gcloud, kubectl and others) and offers a persistent 5GB home directory. Open the Google Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon on the top right of the screen:

2. Check to see if Cloud Shell's Boost mode is Enabled.
